This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and attempting to store a value that is not a string. AsyncStorage only supports storing strings.  Attempting to store other data types such as objects or numbers will result in this error, often silently failing or causing unexpected behavior later in the application. 

Example of problematic code:
```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const storeData = async (value) => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('@my_key', value);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Failed to store the data:', e);
  }
};

// Incorrect usage: storing an object
storeData({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 });
```
